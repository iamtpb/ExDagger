# ExDagger
An example of how to inject dependencies with Dagger. 
This app will be for a Udacity Android Nanodegree webcast wherein we explain a little about dependency injection with Dagger 2 and how to implement it. 
It's also a soup of Square/Jake Wharton libraries so you will see how to use Retrofit, OkHttp, and Picasso in conjunction with Dagger 2.
